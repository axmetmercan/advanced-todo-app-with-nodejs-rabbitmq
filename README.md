# Achievements

With this project, I ventured into backend API development with Express.js. Additionally, I incorporated basic RabbitMQ functionality to send email notifications to users regarding incomplete todos. Furthermore, users can upload images for their todos, which are automatically resized, cropped, and stored within the system.
